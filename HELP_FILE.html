          <p>
            Solve_LP is a CLI (Command Line Interface) developed to be an easy
            tool to solve Linear Programming Problems. Since it is fully
            implemented in Python, Solve_LP is Operational System independent,
            that is, any device having a Python interpreter installed can run
            it in its terminal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The choice to have a CLI to solve this kind of problems instead of
            a traditional GUI (Graphical User Interface) or leave the Linear
            Programming question to dedicated implementations came from

          <p>
            Following the core objective of this project - to be an
            <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>versatile</strong> tool to solve Linear
            Programming problems - Solve_LP can handle different types of
            input types, some of them pretty common as .json and .mps, and
            others developed as part of the project, as the Solve_LP model
            format and the matricial input format, based on the SciLab array
            format. In this section we describe how to use it to input, solve and output results in
            different formats.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first point we have to emphasize is that we are not developing a new modeling language or
            optimization solver, but assembling the existing tools into a lightweight and user-friendly CLI
            to help the process of inputing Linar Programming problems in a solving environment and solving
            them without the need of using robust hard coded implementations to tackle small problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, we may say Solve_LP was developed to help students and researchers to achieve faster
            results when dealing with small experiments, where the model being studied is not a well defined
            formulation for a problem, but a particular case of some problem. It does not mean Solve_LP
            cannot be used in larger production contexts, but the vectorial way data is inputed in its
            interface is more raw than in problem dedicated greater implementations. We will discuss the
            pros and cons of each type of problem input in what follows.
