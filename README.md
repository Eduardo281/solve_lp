# solve_lp
A simple python Linear Programming solver to be used from the Command Line

This is a simple Linear Programming solver made in python to be used directly from the Command Line, built using Google's OR Tools modeling language and SCIP optimization solver.

The main idea of the project is to offer a simple resource to work with "small" linear programming (including, or not, binary/integer variables) using two different types of inputs: long LP models, based on the LP Solve Windows GUI format or small matrix file inputs, based on the Octave/SciLab matrix format.
