# Solve_lp

## A CLI to solve Linear Programming Problems

### Introduction

**Solve_LP** is a CLI (Command Line Interface) developed to be an **easy** tool to solve Linear Programming Problems (real, integer or mixed-integer). Since it is fully implemented in Python, **Solve_LP** is Operational System independent, that is, any device having a Python interpreter installed can run it in its terminal.

In a few words, **Solve_LP** solves MILP problems by calling powerful modeling languages/linear programming solvers through simple command line instructions, and so it's not a modeling language nor a MILP solver. More informations about it are being added into the `User_Guide.pdf` file.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** We are still finishing **Solve_LP** documentation. The three references users may use at this time are:
>
> - The `User_Guide.pdf` at the *User_Guide* folder;
> - The `Example files` at the *Examples* folder;
> - The CLI `--help` and `--help-with-solvers` arguments
