# Solve_LP

## A CLI to solve Linear Programming Problems

### Introduction

**Solve_LP** is a CLI (Command Line Interface) developed to be an **easy** tool to solve Linear Programming Problems (real, integer or mixed-integer). Since it is fully implemented in Python, **Solve_LP** is Operational System independent, that is, any device having a Python interpreter installed can run it in its terminal.

In a few words, **Solve_LP** solves MILP problems by calling powerful modeling languages/linear programming solvers through simple command line instructions, and so it's not a modeling language nor a MILP solver. More informations about it are being added into the `User_Guide.pdf` file.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** We are still finishing **Solve_LP** documentation. The three references users may use at this time are:

- The `User_Guide.pdf` at the *User_Guide* folder;
- The `Example files` at the *Examples* folder;
- The CLI `--help` and `--help-with-solvers` arguments

**DEVELOPMENT NOTES:** This project was initially developed as an study project, and the code still needs some more cleaning, as well as new features. If you find any bug or want to contribute with the **Solve\_LP** project, please submit your findings and/or suggestions in the issues section of this repository. Any help is welcome.
