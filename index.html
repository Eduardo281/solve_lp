          Simple, direct... right from your terminal.

        <p>
          The choice to have a CLI to solve this kind of problems instead of a traditional GUI (Graphical User
          Interface) or leave the Linear Programming question to dedicated implementations came from

        <p>
          Following the core objective of this project - to be an <strong>easy</strong> and <strong>versatile</strong>
          tool to solve Linear Programming problems - <span id="solve-lp-span">Solve_LP</span> can handle different
          types of input types, some of them
          pretty common as .json and .mps, and others developed as part of the project, as the <span
            id="solve-lp-span">Solve_LP</span> model format
          and the matricial input format, based on the SciLab array format. In this section we describe how to use it
          to input, solve and output results in different formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first point we have to emphasize is that we are not developing a new modeling language or optimization
          solver, but assembling the existing tools into a lightweight and user-friendly CLI to help the process of
          inputing Linar Programming problems in a solving environment and solving them without the need of using
          robust hard coded implementations to tackle small problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, we may say <span id="solve-lp-span">Solve_LP</span> was developed to help students and researchers
          to achieve faster results
          when dealing with small experiments, where the model being studied is not a well defined formulation for a
          problem, but a particular case of some problem. It does not mean <span id="solve-lp-span">Solve_LP</span>
          cannot be used in larger
          production contexts, but the vectorial way data is inputed in its interface is more raw than in problem
          dedicated greater implementations. We will discuss the pros and cons of each type of problem input in what
          follows.
